## Concept 1: Peers

Peers or peer nodes are one of the main elements that combine into a distributed network in a blockchain. 
Each Peer hosts one or more ledgers and smart contracts. 
Peers can be connected and removed from the network. They provide a set of functionalities 
that clients are able to use.

## Concept 2: Consensus

The state of the ledgers should be synchronized throughout the blockchain. Consensus is the process of ensuring that the
ledgers are updated if and when a required set of participants approve, and the order of transactions is similar.
